# Python 100 Project

Welcome to my **Python-100-Project** repository! This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Python through 100 different projects. Currently, I have completed **41 projects** and plan to continue expanding my knowledge.

## 🚀 Current Progress: 41/100

I have completed 41 projects out of the planned 100. You can browse through the completed projects in the repository.

## 📝 Notable Completed Projects:

- **Guess the Number Game**: A command-line game where the user guesses a random number generated by the computer.
- **Basic Calculator**: A simple Python-based calculator that can handle basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **To-Do List App**: A command-line app that allows users to manage tasks with functionality like adding, deleting, and viewing tasks.
- **Web Scraper**: A Python script that scrapes data from a website and stores it in a CSV file using libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.

For a full list of completed projects, you can [browse the repository folders](https://github.com/shivam8552051878/Python-100-Projects).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- Libraries like `requests`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `BeautifulSoup`, etc.

## 🌱 Why I Started This Journey

I started this challenge to build practical Python projects while learning different aspects of programming, from basic syntax to more complex topics like API interaction, web scraping, and data visualization.

## 🚧 What's Next?

I am currently on a break from the challenge but plan to continue working on the remaining **59 projects** soon.
